# mach_msg函数

mach_msg定义如下：
```c
mach_msg_return_t mach_msg(
	mach_msg_header_t *msg,
	mach_msg_option_t option,
	mach_msg_size_t send_size,
	mach_msg_size_t rcv_size,
	mach_port_name_t rcv_name,
	mach_msg_timeout_t timeout,
	mach_port_name_t notify);
```
msg为要发送或接收消息的buff。

option经常用的是MACH_SEND_MSG和MACH_RCV_MSG这两个宏。

send_size和rcv_size是发送或接收时指定的大小。

rcv_name是接收的port。

timeout是超时设置。

notify是通知消息状态的port。

消息包括header、body和trailer。

# msg header

header的结构体：
```c
typedef	struct 
{
	mach_msg_bits_t		msgh_bits;
	mach_msg_size_t		msgh_size;
	mach_port_t			msgh_remote_port;
	mach_port_t			msgh_local_port;
	mach_port_name_t	msgh_voucher_port;
	mach_msg_id_t		msgh_id;
} mach_msg_header_t;
```
msgh_bits对于complex消息，需设置MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX宏，同时设置MACH_MSGH_BITS(remote, local)宏用于确定发送消息给对端的port right，或者使用MACH_MSGH_BITS_LOCAL(bits)和MACH_MSGH_BITS_REMOTE(bits)宏取出消息接收到的port right，具体参考如下：

>In a sent message, the following mach_msg_type_name_t values denote port rights:
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND
>
>The message will carry a send right, but the caller must supply a receive right. The send right is created from the receive right, and the receive right's make-send count is incremented.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_COPY_SEND
>
>The message will carry a send right, and the caller must supply a send right. The user reference count for the supplied send right is not changed. The caller may also supply a dead name and the receiving task will get MACH_PORT_DEAD.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND
>
>The message will carry a send right, and the caller must supply a send right. The user reference count for the supplied send right is decremented, and the right is destroyed if the count becomes zero. Unless a receive right remains, the name becomes available for recycling. The caller may also supply a dead name, which loses a user reference, and the receiving task will get MACH_PORT_DEAD.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_MAKE_SEND_ONCE
>
>The message will carry a send-once right, but the caller must supply a receive right. The send-once right is created from the receive right. Note that send once rights can only be created from the receive right.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND_ONCE
>
>The message will carry a send-once right, and the caller must supply a send-once right. The caller loses the supplied send-once right. The caller may also supply a dead name, which loses a user reference, and the receiving task will get MACH_PORT_DEAD.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_RECEIVE
>
>The message will carry a receive right, and the caller must supply a receive right. The caller loses the supplied receive right, but retains any send rights with the same name. The make-send count and sequence number of the receive right are reset to zero and no-more-senders notification requests are cancelled (with a send-once notification being sent to the no-more-senders notification right), but the port retains other attributes like queued messages and extant send and send-once rights. If a message carries a send or send-once right, and the port dies while the message is in transit, then the receiving task will get MACH_PORT_DEAD instead of a right.
The following mach_msg_type_name_t values in a received message indicate that it carries port rights:
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_PORT_SEND
>
>This value is an alias for MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND. The message carried a send right. If the receiving task already has send and/ or receive rights for the port, then that name for the port will be reused. Otherwise, the right will have a new, previously unused, name. If the task already has send rights, it gains a user reference for the right (un- less this would cause the user-reference count to overflow). Otherwise, it acquires send rights, with a user-reference count of one.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_PORT_SEND_ONCE
>
>This value is an alias for MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_SEND_ONCE. The message carried a send-once right. The right will have a new, previously unused, name.
>
>MACH_MSG_TYPE_PORT_RECEIVE
>
>This value is an alias for MACH_MSG_TYPE_MOVE_RECEIVE. The message carried a receive right. If the receiving task already has send rights for the port, then that name for the port will be reused; otherwise, the right will have a new, previously unused name.

msgh_size仅表示接收消息的大小，包括header、body、trailer和inline data。

msgh_remote_port和msgh_local_port表示消息的对端端口和本地端口。

msgh_voucher_port暂时用不到。

msgh_id表示消息id。

# msg body

header之后紧随body，如果是simple消息，body部分就是inline data；如果是complex消息，body定义如下：
```c
typedef struct
{
	mach_msg_size_t msgh_descriptor_count;
} mach_msg_body_t;
```
msgh_descriptor_count表示后面跟随的descriptor数量。

# msg descriptor

descriptor一共有四种，定义如下：
```c
typedef struct
{
	natural_t					pad1;
	mach_msg_size_t				pad2;
	unsigned int				pad3 : 24;
	mach_msg_descriptor_type_t	type : 8;
} mach_msg_type_descriptor_t;

typedef struct
{
	mach_port_t					name;
	// Pad to 8 bytes everywhere except the K64 kernel where mach_port_t is 8 bytes
	
	mach_msg_size_t				pad1;
	unsigned int				pad2 : 16;
	mach_msg_type_name_t		disposition : 8;
	mach_msg_descriptor_type_t	type : 8;
} mach_msg_port_descriptor_t;

typedef struct
{
	void*						address;
	#if !defined(__LP64__)

	mach_msg_size_t				size;
	#endif

	boolean_t					deallocate: 8;
	mach_msg_copy_options_t		copy: 8;
	unsigned int				pad1: 8;
	mach_msg_descriptor_type_t	type: 8;
	#if defined(__LP64__)

	mach_msg_size_t				size;
	#endif

} mach_msg_ool_descriptor_t;

typedef struct
{
	void*						address;
	#if !defined(__LP64__)

	mach_msg_size_t				count;
	#endif

	boolean_t					deallocate: 8;
	mach_msg_copy_options_t		copy: 8;
	mach_msg_type_name_t		disposition : 8;
	mach_msg_descriptor_type_t	type : 8;
	#if defined(__LP64__)

	mach_msg_size_t				count;
	#endif

} mach_msg_ool_ports_descriptor_t;
```
deallocate为true时，address代表的buff明确被vm_deallocate。

copy为MACH_MSG_VIRTUAL_COPY时，由内核决定拷贝方式，为MACH_MSG_PHYSICAL_COPY时，内核确实拷贝了一份内存，port arrays总是使用MACH_MSG_PHYSICAL_COPY。

# msg trailer

trailer也分很多种，不再一一举例，当内核申请内存保存消息时，trailer被假定大小是MAX_TRAILER_SIZE。

# 总结

继续扩充中……
